ST001,The Intro,Stormzy,"What you're about to hear is material that has been written and recorded in 168 hours. Many believe an accomplishment of this stature is staged or over-exaggerated in some way, shape or form. To some, this may even be deemed impossible. However, opinions and views cannot dispute fact. 7 days, 1 week, 168 hours. 168, the mixtape You know what it is, yeah? It's not even the fact that I'm, that I'm underrated or, or the fact that I'm, I'm being slept on. It's the, it's the fact that people don't think I'm a threat, do you understand? People don't think that I'm, that I'm one to be, to be looked out for, one to be watched. And that's when it becomes a problem, that's when I have to rise up and become a problem, do you understand? Cause last year I put out some unprecedented shit. You know what I'm saying? So, but man can see me, and to know what I'm on, and man still want to sleep on me, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to rise up and become a problem. I'm gonna have to kill everyone. That's what it basically is Look, I'm a fucking problem And these rappers just don't seem to comprehend And all these little niggas wanna hype up on the Twitter Then salute me when I buck and when they see me on the ends Hate when bruddas stalk me on my ones and try approach me like a dummy Then they crumble when they see me with my friends These rappers is pricks, I'm back on my shit, I carry my strip And see them dickheads, I will not feature with them They let the beast out of the pen, they let me out my cage I'm a [?] to the game, I will not speak of it again Went from grime to rap and nowadays I'm kinda back But sometimes I just feel to go and fucking cheat on it again Had to free the realness, come and tell me what the deal is And plus I fucking sick, illness is leaking out my pen Had the rap game sussed, was about to fucking buss But the condom split, I ain't beating it again So I missed him with the shot, but I caught him on the rebound Mic check, check 1-2, can I speak now? Lights out, knock a little nigga for the [?] [?] I like to play nice with my teeth out [?] from my conscience to my deep down He said it's on Michael, kill em all Michael Then I said ""OK, let the beast out"" I'm like that nigga Bane [?] See, I bring a lot of pain, I'm coming from the block They're saying Stormzy's in the way, someone come and stop But I'm a fucking problem, that's my fucking problem"
ST002,In For The Kill,Stormzy,"We can fight our desires, ooh But when we start making fires We get ever so hot, ooh Whether we like it or not They say we can love who we trust, ooh But what is love without lust Two hearts with accurate devotion, ooh What are feelings without emotions? I'm going in for the kill I'm doing it for a thrill Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand And not let go of my hand Jack played me the beat, I was gassed Then he asked ""what you gonna do when you rap to the tune?"" I said hold on, let me just spaz I'mma go mad, turn the whole thing up in my speaker Let me tear the whole ting down, fuck a feature Jumping around in my house, Cause he gotta calm down, take a breather Peng tings on the WhatsApp, peng tings on my BB too Fuckboys wanna see me lose, shine bright like RiRi's tune Still got an item in a rucksack, but now I've got CDs too Ayy, look fuckboy, be you, if you say you've done that then I must've, me too Wretch man if I'm 32 Still got love for my CDs too Wanna beef Gotta beef me too Wanna squeeze that Jack?

ST003,Lay You Down,Stormzy,"I come through; she's sitting on my bed Pretty women in a dress but I'm trying to paint the scene like the image in my head She text me before saying what she really needs really can't be delivered in a text Said I'm letting off a trigger in her chest, she needs to see a nigga in the flesh So now I'm kissing on her neck, my fingers slide to the middle of her legs Then I creep inside and she shivers when I pressed, I free her mind and I'm killing her regrets I show how I differ from the rest and she wants more so I'm just fulfilling her request Wants an encore even when we finish we reset Put a rum board baby girl's giving it her best We're far gone, now don't go and ruin our escape Cause we're far from the city and you're way too pretty to be screwing up your face Cut all that mad shit that you talk, just put some mad shit in my thoughts Three rounds that's a hat-trick, oh my lord That girl must of practise on my course Got a mind and a [?], I watch her mind unfold She's riding me slow, with the lights down low Let me lay you down, let me make you smile Only one chance let me make it count Let me break it down I don't really know too much about your past But baby just shush, cause you already said that you wanna make it last Go and smoke that kush, I'll be right here, I'm here all day I like you too but I won't say it You can't tune out, ca I won't stay Tried to run game but you really won't play Let me lay you down Let me lay you down Let me lay you down Let me lay you down Let me lay you down Let me lay you down Let me lay you down"
ST004,Princess & The Bandit,Stormzy,"She said she's tired of my antics Came to her uni and I had a madness with one little dickhead on her campus Now I'm looking like a villain ca' I find it hard to fit in with the high life and the champers And I always fuck it up when I try and buckle up and then attempt to be romantic She's the princess, I'm the bandit She's the painting; I'm the canvas but this pictures not so pretty I'm just trying to understand this, could you tell me what the plan is Could you spare me with the pity? We're not speaking the same language But see all my problems vanish every single time you're with me So why should I be embarrassed when I bring you to my city? Baby welcome to my city"

I'll always try and stop you tripping, but it's awkward if you slipping up yourself, I ain't perfect though. That's why I haven't stopped my search yet. Looking for what?

Feels like I ain't worked a day in my life but I've worked every hour, work any hour. 5am's cool; I get paid by the hour. Where's my phone? What's the time? What? Can't be, can't be. 5am and I can't sleep it's been the same for the past week. I've been up from morning, my daughters clogged up ? I smile cus she's breathing; I turned on my line in the evening It's Friday, I know I've gotta grind through the weekend. So even if it's 5 o'clock, there's no way that my grind can stop, my funds rising, the suns on the horizon, I stop and admire it. Then it's back to curb work, as the birds chirp, I'm out trying to catch the first worm. No hourglass, no sun dial as the hours pass, not one smile as I wipe the cold from my eye; I'm colder than ice. I look down and the phone saying 5. 5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again.
