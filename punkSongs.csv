CL049,Something About England,The Clash,They say immigrants steal the hubcaps Of the respected gentlemen They say it would be wine an' roses If England were for Englishmen again Well I saw a dirty overcoat At the foot of the pillar of the road Propped inside was an old man Whom time would not erode When the night was snapped by sirens Those blue lights circled past The dancehall called for an' ambulance The bars all closed up fast My silence gazing at the ceiling While roaming the single room I thought the old man could help me If he could explain the gloom You really think it's all new You really think about it too The old man scoffed as he spoke to me I'll tell you a thing or two I missed the fourteen-eighteen war But not the sorrow afterwards With my father dead and my mother ran off My brothers took the pay of hoods The twenties turned the north was dead The hunger strike came marching south At the garden party not a word was said The ladies lifted cake to their mouths The next war began and my ship sailed With battle orders writ in bed In five long years of bullets and shells We left ten million dead The few returned to old Piccadily We limped around Leicester Square The world was busy rebuilding itself The architects could not care But how could we know when I was young All the changes that were to come? All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield And now the terror of the scientific sun There was masters an' servants an' servants an' dogs They taught you how to touch your cap But through strikes an' famine an' war an' peace England never closed this gap So leave me now the moon is up But remember all the tales I tell The memories that you have dredged up Are on letters forwarded from hell The streets were by now deserted The gangs had trudged off home The lights clicked off in the bedsits An' old England was all alone
CL050,Rebel Waltz,The Clash,"I slept and I dreamed of a time long ago I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires, A song of the battle, that was born in the flames, and the rebels were waltzing on air. I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz that was written to be danced on the battlefield I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl A voice that called ""Stand till we fall we stand till all the boys fall."" As we danced came the news that the war was not won 5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun Through the heart of the camp swept the news from the front A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food We knew the war could not be won. So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun in a glade through the trees i saw my only one Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing. The song was an old rebel one. As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise A voice began to call, stand till you fall The tune was an old rebel one."

I'm no hero Of the great, intelligent, magnificent human race. I'm part of the race that kills for possessions Part of the race that's wiping itself out. I'm part of the race that's got crazy obsessions Like locking people up, not letting them out. I hate the living dead and their work in factories. They go like sheep to their production lines. They live on illusions, don't face the realities, All they live for is that big blue sign, it says... it says Ford Well Dagenham might not feel it Dagenham might not feel it Dagenham might not feel it but I'm bored, bored, bored, bored."
CR004,They've Got Bomb,Crass,"They won't destroy the world, no, they're not that crazy. You're dealing with the town hall. They're not that crazy. No political solution so why should we bother? Well whose fucking head do you think they're holding over? FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. FIRE. They can't wait to use it. They can't wait to use it. They can't wait to try it out. They can't wait to use it. They've got a bomb. They've got a bomb And they can't wait to use it on me. Twenty odd years now waiting for the flash... Twenty odd years now waiting for the flash, All of the oddballs thinking we'll be ash. Well the four minute warning has run on into years, Are we waiting for them to confirm our fears? FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. FIRE. They can't wait to use it. They can't wait to use it. They can't wait to try it out. They can't wait to use it. They've got a bomb. They've got a bomb And they can't wait to use it on me. They can build them small, call it tactical. Stop the fallout, make it practical To smash the misfits who foul up their scene With the practical, tactical, killing machine. FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. FIRE. They can't wait to use it. They can't wait to use it. They can't wait to try it out. They can't wait to use it. They've got a bomb. They've got a bomb And they can't wait to use it on me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. I. Me. Me. Me."
CR005,Punk Is Dead,Crass,"Yes that's right, punk is dead, It's just another cheap product for the consumers head. Bubblegum rock on plastic transistors, Schoolboy sedition backed by big time promoters. CBS promote the Clash, But it ain't for revolution, it's just for cash. Punk became a fashion just like hippy used to be And it ain't got a thing to do with you or me. Movements are systems and systems kill. Movements are expressions of the public will. Punk became a movement cos we all felt lost, But the leaders sold out and now we all pay the cost. Punk narcissism was social napalm, Steve Jones started doing real harm. Preaching revolution, anarchy and change As he sucked from the system that had given him his name. Well I'm tired of staring through shit stained glass, Tired of staring up a superstars arse, I've got an arse and crap and a name, I'm just waiting for my fifteen minutes fame. Steve Jones you're napalm, If you're so pretty (vacant) why do you swarm? Patti Smith you're napalm, You write with your hand but it's Rimbaud's arm. And me, yes I, do I want to burn? Is there something I can learn? Do I need a business man to promote my angle? Can I resist the carrots that fame and fortune dangle? I see the velvet zippies in their bondage gear, The social elite with safety-pins in their ear, I watch and understand that it don't mean a thing, The scorpions might attack, but the systems stole the sting. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD."
CR006,Reject Of Society,Crass,"Not for me the factory floor, Sweeping up from nine to four. Not for me the silly rat race, I don't see the point in any case. People ask me why I say what I do, I say to them, ""Well wouldn't you?"" If you were fucked up just like me, A reject of society. They say I dig a hole and jump right in, Well I don't give a shit about anything, I don't comply to their silly rules, All they are is hypocritical fools. You give us conscience money, Now you start to worry. The Frankenstein monster you created Has turn against you now you're hated. They tell me I'm not what they'd like me to be, It's their fault, you can't blame me. They fucking tricked me half the time Now they've got to stand in line. They don't like it when they see me have fun, They turn around and then they run. They don't listen to what I say, I'm a reject of society. You give us conscience money, Now you start to worry. The Frankenstein monster you created Has turn against you now you're hated. You give us conscience money, Now you start to worry. The Frankenstein monster you created Has turn against you now you're hated. You give us conscience money, Now you start to worry. The Frankenstein monster you created Has turn against you now you're hated."
CR007,General Bacardi,Crass,"I've seen it all before, Revolution at my back door, Well whose to say it won't happen all again. Cos the General's sip bacardi, while the privates feel the pain. They talk from the screen and T.V. tube. They talk revolution like it's processed food. They talk of anarchy from music hall stages, Look for change in colour supplement pages. They think that by talking from some distant tower, That something might change in the structure of power. They dream, they dream, never walk on the street. They dream, they dream, never stand on their feet. I've seen it all before, Revolution at my back door, Well whose to say it won't happen all again. Cause the General's sip bacardi, while the privates feel the pain. Alternative values were a fucking con. They never really meant it when they said ""Get it on"". They really meant, ""Mine, that's mine"", can't you see? They stamped on our heads so that they could be free. They formed little groups, like rich mans ghettoes, Tending their goats and organic tomatoes. While the world was being fucked by fascist regimes, They talked of windmills and psychedelic dreams. I've seen it all before, Revolution at my back door, Well whose to say it won't happen all again. Cause the General's sip bacardi, while the privates feel the pain."
CR008,Banned From The Roxy,Crass,"Banned from the Roxy... O.K. I never much liked playing there anyway. They said they only wanted well behaved boys, Do they think guitars and microphones are just fucking toys? Fuck 'em, I chosen to make my stand, Against what I feel is wrong with this land. They just sit there on their overfed arses, Feeding off the sweat of less fortunate classes. They keep their fucking power cause their finger's on the button, They've got control and won't let it be forgotten. The truth of their reality is at the wrong end of a gun, The proof of that is Belfast and that's no fucking fun. Seeing the squaddy lying in the front yard, Seeing the machine guns resting on the fence. Finding the entrance to your own front door is barred And they've got the fucking nerve to call it defence. Seems their defence is just the threat of strength, Protection for the privileged at any length. The government protecting their profits from the poor, The rich and the fortunate chaining up the door. Afraid that the people may ask for a little more Than the shit they get. The shit they get. The shit they get. The shit they get. The shit they get. The shit they get. The shit they get. The shit they get. Defence? shit, it's nothing less than war And no one but the government knows what the fuck it's for. Oh yes they say it's defence, they say it's decency, Mai Lai, Hiroshima, know what I mean? The same fucking lies with depressing frequency, They say ""We had to do it to keep our lives clean"" Well whose life? Whose fucking life? Who the fuck are they talking to? Whose life? Whose fucking life? I tell you one thing, it ain't me and you. And their system, christ, they're everywhere, School, army, church, corporation deal. A fucked up reality based on fear, A fucking conspiracy to stop you feeling real. Well ain't got me, I'd say they're fucking wrong, I ain't quite ready with my gun, but I've got my song... Banned from the Roxy, well O.K. I never much liked playing there anyway. Guns."
CR009,G's Song,Crass,"This country tells us that we're down and out, Got you thinking that we're through. Got to suffer to get us moving, Say it's up to me and you. Well, look around and you'll see who gets the goods, not you or me. Cause they ain't suffering, no, not for us, They're masquerading like pissers must. They abuse us, keep us right underfoot, With the illusions of contentment and good. Well, it's not over, war's still around And they've got no problem when you're underground."
CR010,"Fight War, Not Wars",Crass,"Fight war, not wars. Fight war, not wars. Fight war, not wars. Fight war, not wars. Fight war, not wars. Fight war, not wars. Fight war, not wars. FIGHT WAR, NOT WARS."
CR011,Women,Crass,"Fuck is women's money. We pay with our bodies. There is no purity in our love. No beauty. Just bribery. It's all the fucking same. We make soldiers with our submission. Wars with our isolation. Fuck is women's money. We pay with our bodies. There no purity in motherhood. No beauty. Just bribery. It's all the fucking same. We are all slaves to sexual histories. Our awareness of whoredom can be release. War is men's money. They pay with their bodies. There is no purity in that game, Only blood, death and bribery. It's all the fucking same. But we've got the power. Don't just stand there and take submission on the strength of fear. FIGHT WAR, NOT WARS."
CR012,Securicor,Crass,"I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army. I am a working for securicor, Take the money and come back for more. I want to do it cause I know I should, For the customer and the common good. I walk around with a big Alsatian, He'll re-arrange you with no provocation, And I'm the bugger who has got the lead, You'll have to be bright if you want to get at me. Securicor cares. Securicor cares. Securicor scares the shit out of you, Do you want to come closer? I block the pavement with my club and hat, I deal in money that you can't get at. You want to use me cause I'm up for rent, Tough shit, cause I'm real busy. You ought to know me cause I've been a cop, Out at the army where I learned a lot. Some kids still chuckle when they see my van, But it's not all money sonny, you want to come closer? Securicor cares. Securicor cares. Securicor scares the shit out of you, Do you want to come closer? DO YOU WANT TO COME CLOSER? Well I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm a private in a private army, I'm A PRIVATE IN A PRIVATE ARMY."

Marx fucks. Do you really believe in Thatcher? Maggie sucks. Is it alright really? Is it alright really? Is it working? Do you really believe in the system? Well o.k. I BELIEVE IN ANARCHY IN THE U.K. Is it alright really? Is it alright really? Is it working?
CR014,You Pay,Crass,"You're paying for prisons. You're paying for war. You're paying for lobotomies. You're paying for law. You're paying for their order. You're paying for their murder. Paying for your ticket To watch the farce. Knowing you've made you're contribution To the systems fucked solution, To their political pollution. No chance of revolution. No chance of change. You've got no range. Don't just take it. Don't take their shit. Don't' play their game. Don't take their blame. USE YOUR OWN HEAD. Your turn instead. It's not apologise. It's not economise. It's not make do. It's not pull through. It's not take it. It's not make it. It's not just you. It's not madmen. It's not difficult. It's not behave. It's not, oh well, just this once. It's fucking impossible. It's fucking unbearable. It's fucking stupid. FUCKING STUPID."
CR015,Angels,Crass,"The angels are on T.V. tonight, grey puke, celluloid shit. The army have sent a mission to Ireland, just to see to it. Kojac is on the streets again, grey puke, fucking shit. The army say they seek peace in Ireland and they'll see to it. That they keep in line, horizontal hold. Keep in line, vertical hold. Keep in line, brightness. Keep in line, contrast. Keep in line, VISION ON. Coronation Street is on twice a week, grey puke, fucking shit. The army say they seek peace in Ireland and they'll see to it. The army are on the news report. REAL WARS. BULLETS. DEATH. They're beating fuck out of someone they caught just to see to it. That they keep in line, horizontal hold. Keep in line, vertical hold. Keep in line, contrast. Keep in line, brightness. Keep in line, VISION OFF."
CR016,What A Shame,Crass,"It doesn't take much to bring you down. There are plenty of people standing round. They wait till you slacken off just a bit. Then they fill you up with passive bullshit. It's too good. It can't last. What a shame. Watch out for the quiet ones at the back. All they want is the smallest crack. Everything's happening down the front. Innocent bystander you're the biggest runt. Fuck the punks. Punks are fucked. It's too loud. Awful row. They can't play. They'll give up. In the end. What a shame. Oh! what a shame! Oh! what a shame! It's still the same, That's what you think. Watch out for the quiet ones at the back. All they want is the smallest crack. Everything's happening down the front. Innocent bystander you're the biggest runt. We all now, It's so bad, But we say so. What a shame."
CR017,So What,Crass,"They ask me why I'm hateful, why I'm bad. They tell me I got things they never had. They tell me go to church and see the light. Cos the good lord's always right. So what, so what. So what if Jesus died on the cross. So what about the fucker, I don't give a toss. So what if the master walked on the water. I don't see him trying to stop the slaughter. They say I wouldn't have to live from bins. If I would go along, confess my sins. They say I shouldn't commit no crime. Cos Jesus Christ is watching all the time. So what, so what. So what if he's always over my shoulder. I realise the truth as I get older. I get to see what a con it is. Because it's my life, mine not his. Well, they say they're going to send me away. Said they're going to make me pay. We're sorry but you got to go. But you were naughty, you said ""No"". So what, so what. So what if I see through the lies. So what if the people I despise Twist my arm and make me work, I'm no deaf, dumb fucking jerk. I'm no spastic lying in the street. I'm no superstar elite. I'm just a person, a human being. No you're not, you're a part of the machine. You're a part our machine because we want you to be. We've got you now and you'll never be free. We can even have your body after you're dead. We can take the eyes out of your fucking head. Yes we'll take them out, use them again. We can do it you know cos we've got your brain. We'll crucify you like we crucified him. We'll make you obey our every whim. We got the power, the power and the glory. I've heard that before in a different story. But the story I heard covered up the truth, Didn't touch on the actual factual proof. Didn't say about the bodies in the concentration camps, Didn't say about the knives underneath the lamps, Doesn't say that the ovens are still warm, Doesn't say that this wretched little form Is a human being who wants to live But not in the snot and shit they give. They say that I had better keep quiet Or they're gonna douse my light. Jesus Christ can save my life, But I can always use my knife. So what, so what, so what, so what, So what, so what, so what, so what."
CR018,Well?...Do They?,Crass,"Fuck the politically minded, here's something I want to say, About the state of nation, the way it treats us today. At school they give you shit, drop you in the pit, You try, you try, you try to get out, but you can't because they've fucked you about. Then you're a prime example of how they must not be, This is just a sample of what they've done to you and me. Do they owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they fucking do. Don't want me anymore, cos I threw it on the floor. Used to call me sweet thing, I'm nobody's plaything, And now that I am different, you'd love to bust my head, You'd love to see me cop-out, love to see me dead. Do they owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they fucking do. The living that is owed to me I'm never going to get, They've buggered this old world up, up to their necks in debt. They'd give you a lobotomy for something you ain't done, They'll make you an epitomy of everything that's wrong. Do they owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they fucking do. Don't take any notice of what the public think, They're so hyped up with T.V., they just don't want to think. They'll use you as a target for demands and for advice, When you don't want to hear it they'll say you're full of vice. Do they owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they do, of course they do. Owe us a living? Of course they fucking do."
CR019,Mother Earth,Crass,"Now that the sun have vowed its light And bid the world good night; To the soft bed my body I dispose, But where were shall my soul repose? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? She's the anti-mother, mommy is that you? She's the anti-mother, mother, mother is that you? It's Myra Hindley on the cover, Your very own sweet anti-mother. There she is on the pages of The Star, Ain't that just the place you wish you were? Let her rot in hell is what you said, Let her rot, let her starve, you'd see her dead. Let her out but don't forget to tell you where she is, The chance to screw her is a chance you wouldn't miss. Let her suffer, give her pain is the verdict you gave, You just can't wait to piss on her grave. You pretend that you're horrified, make out that you care, But really you wish that you had been there. You say you can't bear the thought of what she did, But you'd do it to her, you'd see her dead. Tell me, what is the difference between her and you? You say that you would kill her, well, what else would you do? Don't you see that violence has no end? Isn't limited by rules? Don't you see as angels preaching you're nothing but the fools? Fools step in, where angels fear to tread, You see, to kill others is the ethic of the dead. She's the anti-mother, mommy is that you? She's the anti-mother, mother, mother is that you? That single mug shot from the past Ensures your fantasy can last and last. It gives you the chance to air your hate Because she got there first, you were too late. Hindleys' crime was to do what others think, Took her anger and her prejudice and pushed it to the brink. Then you goodly christian people, with your sickly mask of love, Would tear that woman limb from limb, you'd never get enough. So you keep the story alive, So you can make yourselves believe, That you are so much better than her. But you aren't, that's YOUR GUILT laying there. She's the anti-mother, mommy is that you? She's the anti-mother, mother, mother is that you? She's the anti-mother, mommy is that you? She's the anti-mother, mother, mother is that you? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother?"
CR020,White Punks On Hope,Crass,"They said that we were trash, Well the name is Crass, not Clash. They can stuff their punk credentials Cause it's them that take the cash. They won't change nothing with their fashionable talk, All their RAR badges and their protest walk, Thousands of white men standing in a park, Objecting to racism's like a candle in the dark. Black man's got his problems and his way to deal with it, So don't fool yourself you're helping with your white liberal shit. If you care to take a closer look at the way things really stand, You'd see we're all just niggers to the rulers of this land. Punk was once an answer to years of crap, A way of saying no where we'd always said yep. But the moment we saw a way to be free, They invented a dividing line, street credibility. The qualifying factors are politics and class, Left wing macho street fighters willing to kick arse. They said because of racism they'd come out on the street. It was just a form of fascism for the socialist elite. Bigotry and blindness, a marxist con, Another clever trick to keep us all in line. Neat little labels to keep us all apart, To keep us all divided when the troubles start. Pogo on a nazi, spit upon a jew, Vicious mindless violence that offers nothing new. Left wing violence, right wing violence, all seems much the same, Bully boys out fighting, it's just the same old game. Boring fucking politics that'll get us all shot, Left wing, right wing, you can stuff the lot. Keep your petty prejudice, I don't see the point, ANARCHY AND FREEDOM IS WHAT I WANT."
CR021,You've Got Big Hands,Crass,"Out of the chaos we divide, Fucked up, muddled up, looking for a side. Stay on the outside, don't go in, Don't think that you can do it, if you sell out they win. It's not like that the changes are made, Give in to them, your chances are delayed. You'll feed with your energies the things that you hate, Diluting your strength each time they say yes. Their hands are big, they've got big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. You're talking with sounds they don't understand, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. They've got big mouths to shout demands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. They'll let you past a couple of times, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. You think you're getting somewhere, you're fucking blind, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. This structures stretches, it'll bend but not break, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. This system channels any threat that you make, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands. It will do anything to accommodate, Accommodate you and your liberal ideas. You're the child in their garden, The dog on their lead, Their token to changes that are never made. Can't you see that for centuries it's been the same, Plenty like you have been seduced to the game. The chain's still as tight, won't let in the light, Can you tell me what's different? Whose hopes you will feed? Will you feed their arses, Will you feed their hands? Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands, Big hands, big hands, big hands, big hands."

CR023,System,Crass,"You can swear by who the fuck you like, But you're still on the roof. I'm not gonna change the system, They're not gonna change the system, We're not gonna change the system, Where does that leave you? Where does that leave me? Jumping up and down to a bunch of tools, The organisation treat us like fools. They can't help it, they didn't make the rules, It's just the system again, BOLLOCKS. Bind us round with ignorance, Fit us up with a petty stance. Fill us up with cheap romance, Leave no option, no chance. What've they got? Fuck all? NO. What've they got? A swimming pool. Where did get it? Follow the rules. System, system. Keeping their fingers on the breaks, Down the ladders, up the snakes, Buy the band and call the tune, Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, Nah, nah, nah, nah."
CR024,"Big Man, Big M.A.N.",Crass,"They're telling you to do it, Grow up and tow the line, They tell you if you do it, Everything will turn out fine. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, what a wonderful life, God, queen, country, colour telly, car and wife. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, what a wonderful life, God, queen, country, colour telly, car and wife. It's great if you can do it, it doesn't take a lot, Just means you must destroy what sensitivity you've got. Well, that's an easy bargain for the things you're going to get, You can treat the wife like shit, own a car, a telly set. Slip off in the evenings for a little on the sly, And if the wife complains, fuck her first, then black her eye. There's lots of worthwhile jobs for the lad who wants to know, Lorry driving's fun, you're always on the go. One hand on the wheel, the other up some cunt, Or jerking off to Penthouse with with motorway up front. The police force offers chances for a bright intelligent lad, To interfere with anyone cos they're there just to be had. It offers quite a range for aggression and for spite, To take out your frustrations in a justifiable light. It's a mans' life in the army, good pay and lots of fun, You can stab them with your bayonet, fuck them with your gun. Look smart in your uniform, that always pulls the skirt, Then when you've fucked them good and proper, tell them they're just dirt. Cos man is spelt big M.A.N. it's the letters of the law. Man is spelt big M.A.N. that's who the law is for. You see there's lots of chances in this land of hope and glory, Try and make your own rules, that's a different story. If you're a man, you'd better act like one, Develop your muscles, use your prick like a gun. Fuck anything that moves, but never pay the price, Steal, fuck, slaughter, that's their advice. Are you man enough? Ask the posters on the walls, Have you got what it takes? Guts and balls? Keep your myth of manhood, it's been going on too long, A history of slaughter is the proof that it is wrong. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N. Big man, big M.A.N.

CR025,Hurry Up Garry (The Parsons Farted),Crass,"The bastards, what are they playing at? Don't like the music, don't like the words, don't like the sentiments, Well keep it for the birds and bees, boys, bastards. Yes that's right, I stepped out of line, What do you want? What do you want? As long as I play it moderate, that's fine, Well, fuck off runt, fuck off runt. Pick your nose with your ball pen, put your snot in sounds, Back to your play pen with your street cred minds. You whimper and whine from the pages of the press, Ridicule and criticise those who want to change this mess. There's people our there who are trying to live, People who care, now, what do you give? So many parasites living off our sweat, So many fuckers in for what they can get, Punk ain't about your standards and your rules, It ain't another product for the suckers and the fools. Your sit behind your typewriters shovelling shit, Rotting in the decadence of your crap lined pit, Waiting for the action so you can grab a part, But it stinks so bad, who's going to smell your fart?

CR026,Fun Going On,Crass,"Maybe you think it's the new new wave, Well, when all it is is just another rave. Maybe it looks like the writing's on the wall, But you've seen it before, it's another death pall. So somebody's coming with an answer to the shit, Just bad rock and roll chivvied up a bit. Someone's looking after it, there's time for a laugh, But you're leading yourself up another garden path. A million people are sitting out of work, I never wanted in, so I'm treated as a shirk. Who's the fool in the Irish joke When the say you've got is your stupid vote. It's all very comfy while they keep the war vocal, But the bombs in Belfast are coming down your local. I wanna know how much you can take, Cos you've taken it all, and that's just great. Go and see a band and it's another fucking bore, Another bunch of jerks are shitting on the poor. Or you might just get the adrenalin rush, Or the jock rot heavy metal leg iron gush. Ave fucking maria is what I say, She's still going strong and it won't go away. You can run religion on a football chant, Or the other way around if that's what you want. You can get anyone crawling through shit, Skivvying their lives away, slaving in the pit. All you need is to have the right key, Comfort and justice and liberty. Hi mum, hi dad, family life, Till your heart blows up from those shitty lies. Have some fun while you're young, son, Fun while you're young, fun while you're young, Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, It's gonna go on, fun, fun, fun, It's gonna go on, fun, fun, fun, It's gonna go on, fun, fun, fun, It's gonna go on, IT'S GONNA GO ON."
CR027,Crutch Of Society,Crass,"Don't want to bury my head in the crutch of society, Perverted parent that takes my energy, Sucking me dry with your morals, your threats, Christ, your queen, your politics. Fucking hypersensitive, super realist humanity, I'm one of your super hybrid community. Commutes the arsehole of economy. Watch out, watch out, it's all about, Reversion's setting in, and I can see you, Staring at me with your seizured brain, Trying to put me down the drain again. Well you're too smart, right from the start, I learned it well that the truth will tell, And you're done for, it's what the son's for, It's what the gun's for, it's what I've come for, You better run bore, you better run bore You better run bore, you better run bore You better run bore, you better run bore You better run bore, you better run bore"
CR028,Heard Too Much About,Crass,"Heard too much about. Heard too much about. Heard too much about. Heard too much about. I've heard too much about the people in the ghetto, Heard too much about the working class motto. People in the ghetto. How you don't know life if you ain't seen the street, Racialist poor against the racialist elite. Heard too much about. A million people in factory and office, Aware there's something missing, but living with their losses. Working class motto. There's no fight to get where they'd rather be, Only the accepting of dependency. Wait in the shop, for what you ain't got, Lying on the beaches for the social elite. Working 9 to 4, revolved around more, Fear, guilt, abuse, love and moral truth. War in your bedroom, bodies in your fridge, Domestic violence, the tomb you dig. Heard too much about. Rules for survival, rules that they wrote, Thinking it's your freedom when it's rammed down your throat. On the boundary, choose your family, Choose what school, no choice at all. Choose what church, it allow you to hurt, Choosing your power, is choosing your hour"

Of hope, future, possibility, To those fucked up mindless people who haven't got the eyes to see, That the pages of The Guardian or the pages of The Sun, Are just a load of fucking lies, are just a fucking con. Why do they feed us rubbish? Why do they feed us shit? Is this really what they think we want? Scrapings from the pit? Why don't they give us something which isn't just their lies, Their own particular angle from their own unseeing eyes? I'm the chairman of the bored, and I'm asking for some truth, truth, truth, truth. I'm the chairman of the bored, and I'm looking for some proof, proof, proof, proof, That there's something more than their fucked up game, That their mindless lives and mine aren't the same. I'm looking for something that I can call my own, Which ain't a Ford Cortina or a mortgage on a home. I'm the chairman of the bored, and I'm looking for some truth, truth, truth, truth.

What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? I'm tired of playing with vice, Tired of hash heads trying to be nice.

You won't print the word, but you'll beat up the wife, In your ignorant, arrogant, terminal life. You have this life, you deprive me of mine, With your twisted, imbalanced idea of sin. That revolves around money; how much are you bought for? A tenner, a fiver, is that what you're caught for? I'm sick of your pride, you think you can rule me, With crappy judgement from your respectable majority. Majority of what? You self oppressed idiot, I'm not going to carry you, I'm no compatriot. How many times do I excuse and forgive The damage inflicted by the way that you live? I hold my vision against your oppression, Your final defence, your only possession. I'll show you the blood, but you'll still point the gun, If the money's enough, or can you show you're a man? To your submissive wife, desperate whore, Home loving, mothering, stifling bore. You have this life, you twist and abuse it, Morals and money and media controls it. Can't you see the dead children, blood in the street? Every fist that you raise is a corpse at your feet. Every time you are bought, I don't care the amount, You are the rapist, dealing in death count. And you do this with mercenary morals, you shit, Oh, you've been told about dignity down in the pit. Respectable working man, honourable wife? A waste of energy and an insult to life."
CR033,The Gasman Cometh,Crass,"The train now standing on platform four, What will you do when the gas taps turn? Where will you be when the bodies burn? Will you just watch as the cattle trucks roll by? Pretend it isn't happening? Turn a blind eye? See the army convoys quietly passing by? Heard the helicopters in your little bit of sky? Have you seen the squad cars packed with boys in blue? Have you ever wondered what they're there to do? Pictures in the paper of soldiers in the street, Pictures in the history books of rotting human meat. Auschwitz's now a tourist spot for the goggle eyed to pry, Still in working order just for you and I. Photos of the victims, of gas, of gun, of bomb, Inheritance of violence in the bookshelves of your home. Don't wait for it to come to you, cos come it surely will, The guardians of the state are trained to search, destroy and kill. There's people sitting at this moment, fingers on the trigger, There's loyalty and royalty to make their violence figure. Allegiance to the flag, they say, as they lock the prison door, Allegiance to normality, that's what lobotomies are for. God, queen and country, they say we've got the choice, Free speech for all if you've got no voice. Propaganda on the airwaves, here's the way to live, Not for you and me the alternative. The look for peace in Ireland with a thousand squaddy boys, Torture in their mental homes is another of their ploys. They'll keep us all in line, by christ, they'll keep us on our toes, But if we stand against their power, we'll see how violence grows. Read it in the paper about rebellious youth, But it's them that are so violent, it's them that hide the truth. Stay in line, or pay the cost, Do you think they care when another life's lost? Auschwitz's now a tourist spot for the goggle eyed to pry, Still in working order just for you and I. To ashes at Auschwitz it's just a small leap, From coshes at Southall, life is cheap. Don't think that they won't do it, cos they already do, But this time 'round the pawns are me and you."

These heroes have run before me, Now dead upon the flesh piles, see? Waiting for their promised resurrection, there is none. Nothing but the marker, crown or cross, in stone upon these graves Promise of the ribbon was all it took, Where only the strap would leave it's mark upon these slaves. What flag to thrust into this flesh Rag, bandage, mop in their flowing death. Taken aside, they were pointed a way, for god, queen and country, Now in silence they lie. They ran beside these masters, children of sorrow, As slaves to that trilogy they had no future. They believed in democracy, freedom of speech, Yet dead on the flesh piles I hear no breath, I hear no hope, no whisper of faith From those who have died for some others' privilege. Out from your palaces, princes and queens, Out from your churches, you clergy, you christs, I'll neither live nor die for your dreams. I'll make no subscription to your paradise.

Cheaper goodies, more time with the family, Don't be fooled with their gestures of equality. The only thing that's equal is your own rotting corpse, Staring at each other to see who'll make it first.

Are you gonna let it shower over you? The new great energy that sucks off yours, Giving all you wanted as it settles in your pores, Make it known just this once that people ain't toys. Cause a disturbance, cause a fucking noise, Atomic power is just another of their ploys, To build their firepower and defend the nation, They expose us to contamination. Contamination, contamination, contamination, Contamination, contamination, contamination, Contains the nation, that old sensation Contamination, contamination, Contamination, contamination, Cause a disturbance, cause a fucking noise, Atomic power is just another of their ploys.

You think you're hard done by, but you just want the same, Chicken thighs, human thighs, it's all the same old game.

Is your reflection all that you will recognise? That cruel lie will stare you in the face. Wrapped up in haze and flow of bridal gown, They tell your lover he must hold a gun. You're the pornographic reassurance he's a man, They deal with flesh, incarcerate with rags, Red lips, shimmer-silk and body-bags, Hairless legs against the blistered napalms burn. I want to rape the substance of your downy hair, In that mist a gutted child fights for air. Against the fragile, mashed and sweaty wound Your facile beauty has an outrageous sound, Like a glamour billboard on a battlefield. At least the blood-red poppy was of nature will, That flower perfecting by the barbed wire fence Must be insulted by your scented poor pretence Just as I, who finds it hard to touch you now, You traumatise my love with needle doubts, I want so gently to remove your mask. It's hard enough to find water here In this barrenness of dishonesty and fear Without you accepting poison in a pretty pill.

Would you see the fire from your sanctuary of death? What terrible pain you need to hide, In your hatred you'd seek to destroy the earth, What is it that you have been denied? Your mind and its rantings are so barren, What the fuck are you thinking? What the fuck? Your eyes and their vision, empty, staring, What the fuck are you seeing? What the fuck? What now? Now you would destroy the earth, Dry the river beds. What now? Now in your control, birth and death, Dry the bodies, incandescent in the heat. So singular your motives, yet impossible to define, How finely lined my destiny in the cobwebs of your crime. So insular your future, so alien your plan, Take all of this if you will and I'll take what I can. A town that is no more, ""My god"", you say, ""what have I done?"" But you won't heed what's gone before, ""What pity?"", you say, ""There is none."" And so you drive the world to war, But this war will not be lost or won, The desolation that you've seen but never saw Is the lesson that you teach, but never learn. But would you see the fire in the world where you exist? Will your hard eyes register the pain? Are you so cold that there is no distress? Where there's death would you give death again? No flowers in your landscape, some withered rose Kicked amongst the corpses where they lay, Halted where all hope died, froze, By the horror of your acts compelled to stay. What now?

Unnoticed all this in your lusting after death, How determined that your darkness should be shared. Unnoticed in your blindness this miracle of breath, What element of beauty attracts your cruel desire? Would you see the burning? Is that your delight? Would you have me see it in your stead? Would you feel my yearning? Peace, life light, Body, breath. Would you take all this? What now? Now you would destroy the earth, Dry the river beds. What now? Now in your control, birth and death, Dry the bodies, incandescent in the heat. What is it that you're seeking, so cold & so deprived? What is it that you dream of in your empty eyeless head?

Anothers left, anothers right, Anothers peace, anothers fight. Marx had an idea from the confusion of his head, Then there were a thousand more waiting to be led. The books are sold, the quotes are bought, You learn them well and then you're caught. Anothers left, anothers right, Anothers peace, anothers fight. Mussolini had an idea from the confusion of his heart, Then there were a thousand more waiting to play their part. The stage was set, the costumes worn And anothers empire of destruction born. Anothers name, anothers aim, Anothers fall, anothers fame. Jung had an idea from the confusion of his dream, Then there were a thousand more waiting to be seen. You're not yourself the theory says, But I can help, your complex pays. Anothers hope, anothers game, Anothers loss, anothers gain. Sartre had an idea from the confusion of his brain, Then there were a thousand more indulging in his pain, Revelling in isolation and existential choice; Can you truly be alone when you use anothers voice? Anothers lies, anothers truth, Anothers doubt, anothers proof. The idea born in someones mind Is nurtured by a thousand blind Anonymous beings, vacuous souls, Do you fear the confusion, your lack of control? You lift your arm to write a name, So caught up in the identity game. Who do you see? Who do you watch? Who's your leader? Which is your flock? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who's your leader? Which is your flock? Who's your leader? Which is your flock? Who's your leader? Which is your flock? Who's your leader? Which is your flock? Einsten had an idea from the confusion of his knowledge, Then there were a thousand more turning to advantage. They realised that their god was dead, So they reclaimed power through the bomb instead. Anothers code, anothers brain, They'll shower us all in deadly rain, Jesus had an idea from the confusion of his soul, Then there were a thousand more waiting to take control. The guilt is sold, forgiveness bought, The cross is there as your reward. Anothers love, anothers pain, Anothers pride, anothers shame. Do you watch at a distance from the side you have chosen? Whose answers serve you best? Who'll save you from confusion? Who will leave you an exit and a comfortable cover? Who will take you so near their edge, but never drop you over? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch? Who do you watch?"
CR044,Berkertex Bribe,Crass,"Berkertex bribe. Oh! Berkertex bribe. Berkertex bribe. Oh! Berkertex bribe. Berkertex bribe. Oh! Berkertex bribe. Berkertex bribe. Oh! Berkertex bribe. The object unsoiled is packed ready and waiting, For the moment of truth in this spiritual mating. The object unsoiled is packed ready and waiting, To be owned, to be cherished, to be fucked for the naming. The public are shocked by the state of society, But as for you, you're a breath of purity. Well don't give me your morals, they're filth in my eyes, You can pack them away with the rest of your lies. Your painted mask of ugly perfection, The ring on your finger, the sign of protection, Is the rape on page 3, it the soldiers obsession, How well you've been caught to support your oppression. One god. One church. One husband. One wife. Sordid sequences in brilliant life, Supports and props and punctuation To our flowing realities and realisations. We're talking with words that have been used before To describe us as goddesses, mother and whores, To describe us as women, describe us as men, To set out the rules of this ludicrous game, And it's played very carefully, a delicate balance, A masculine/feminine perfect alliance. Does the winner take all? What love in your grasping? What vision is left and is anyone asking? What vision is left and is anyone asking? She's a Berkertex bribe... Bribe. Bribe..."
CR045,Smother Love,Crass,"The true romance is the ideal repression, that you seek, That you dream of, that you look for in the streets, That you find in the magazines, the cinema, the glossy shops, And the music spins you round and round looking for the props. The silken robe, the perfect little ring, Will gives you the illusion when it doesn't mean a thing, Step outside into the street and staring from the wall Is perfection of the happiness that makes you feel so small. Romance, can you dance? D'you fit the right description? Do you love me? Do you love me? Do you want me for your own? Do you love me? Say you need me, say you know that I'm the one, Tell me I'm your everything, let us build a home. We can build a house for us, with little ones fellow, The proof of our normality that justifies tomorrow. Romance, romance. Do you love me? Say you do, We can leave the world behind and make it just for two. Love don't make the world go round, it holds it right in place, Keeps us thinking love's too pure to see another face. Love's another skin-trap, another social weapon, Another way to make men slaves and women at their beckon. Love's another sterile gift, another shit condition, That keeps us seeing just the one and others not existing. Woman is a holy myth, a gift of mans expression, She's sweet, defenceless, golden-eyed, a gift of gods repression. If we didn't have these codes for love, of tokens and positions, We'd find ourselves as lovers still, not tokens of possessions. It's a natural, it's a romance, without the power and greed, We can fight to lift the cover if you want to sow and seed. Do you love me? Do you? Do you? Don't you see they aim to smother The actual possibilities of seeing all the others? Do you love me? Do you? Do you? Don't you see they aim to smother The actual possibilities of seeing all the others?"
CR046,Health Surface,Crass,"Places of sickness nurse me cold, Attendant whiteness glare in dark, Straighten out the winding sheet Twisted round in poorest dreams. Shattered proofing of the lost, Splinter shackled, little wounds Of cruelty and truth, they tie The one way sickness up inside. Regressive smile, a baby's laugh, A learnt contortion of the mouth, Places of laughter leave me cool, Hot fire dying down to ash. Beauty breezes through so swift, Endless roundabout of grief. Not much to ask, a rightful place Where nothing matters, but can't touch Without a sinking heart, this sigh Could be the wind among the leaves. This pain does not belong to me, They've taken everything away To nurse the sicknesses of loss, Instilled with fear and bleachy guilt Impatient winds up in her cloth. The tired shoes are splitting up With weighty promises of love, Waiting for the last to fall away Buckle noose around the strap All that separates the flesh From green grass or sinking mud. Stagnating, knowing the delusion, Clean sheets waiting for a body, Slapped into life and slowly gutted. A place of sickness is to die in Tired of the cruelty and lying, Drip-fed tears of the forsaken. They say, ""Well soon have you up and walking"". Took the prison for a stronghold. Took the lies for a love-song. Paid for life on a shoestring. Waiting for the last to fall away Buckle noose around the strap All that separates the flesh From green grass or sinking mud"

You ask me for more when I've spent it, When I've given it all, you still take. Is there anyone prepared to tell me why? Tell me why I'm being suck dry? Oh yes! I know the lines you draw are for protection, The number given for a name is simply for detection, I know I'm only paper in a file, But couldn't you treat me as a human for a while?

Is there anyone prepared to tell me why? Tell me why I'm being suck dry? You offer your protection, but insist when I decline, You offer independence, but demand I tow the line. You say you give me freedom, but you hang on to the key, Well don't you think, perhaps, the decision's up to me? You ride on me, Suck my energy. You take what you want when you want it, You reject any change that I make. You ask me for more when I've spent it, When I've given it all, you still take. Is there anyone prepared to tell me why? Tell me why I'm being suck dry? So tell me I'm dreaming if I want to live And I'll tell you you're just scheming to make me give, More than I want to, more than I can, You don't want person, you just want a woman. You hide behind logic, secure with your facts, You've a history of time to back up your claims, Protecting the future by filling up the cracks That might expose the real nature of your games. You want woman cos she's children for your system, Well people wither in that living death. You hide behind your prejudice, afraid of my wisdom, Afraid I might question your unquestioned worth. You ride on me, Suck my energy. You take what you want when you want it, You reject any change that I make. You ask me for more when I've spent it, When I've given it all, you still take. Is there anyone prepared to tell me why? Tell me why I'm being suck dry? Used as a tool? Treated like a fool? Spat on? Shat on? Totally confused? Fucked up? Mucked up? Totally abused? Pulled about? Fooled about? Treated like a toy? Joked about? Poked about? Something to destroy? Tricked? Kicked? I don't want these games."

CR049,Have A Nice Day,Crass,"""Crass by name, even worse by nature, like it or not, they just won't go away. The Crass are the distempered dog-end of rock'n' roll's once bright and vibrant rebellion. That they're so unattractive, unoriginal and badly unbalanced in an uncompromising and humourless extremist sort of way, simply adds to the diseased attraction of their naively black and white world where words are a series of shock slogans and mindless token tantrums to tout around your tribe and toss at passers-by. Good ol' Crass; our make-believe secret society, our lets-pretend passport to perversity. They're nothing but a caricature and a joke."" Same old stuff, you've heard it all before, Crass being crass about the system, or is it war? We ain't got no humour, we don't know how to laugh, If you don't fucking like it - fucking tough! Cos I'm the same old monkey in the same old zoo Same old message trying to get through, Screaming from the platform when the train ain't even there, I've got a one way ticket, but I don't fucking care. If what I've got to say is always much the same, It's cos the game the system plays is still the same old game. Senile idiots in their seats of power, Ancient rotting corpses breathing horror by the hour. They're lovers of death the fucking creeps, Screwing our earth, as our earth weeps. Iron ladies and steel men Waiting for their fucking war to start again. Blood lusting nutters plan death for us all, They'll be hiding in their bunkers as we watch the missiles fall, Ain't they just so decent, respectable and nice, Eating the fat of the land while it's us that pay the price. Westminster's full of psychopaths with blood clots 'stead of brains, Flesh hungry vultures picking our remains, Shitting on the world they've shat on many times before, Fucked it good and proper in the name of law. Well bollocks to the lot of you and you can fuck off too, If you're bored with what I say, no-one's asking you. Just fuck off and have your fun, Hoist your jolly roger and wave your plastic gun, With your painted faces and your elegant style, How about trying to think for a while? As your decorate your lifestyle with cheap consumer bliss, Forget about loving, it's your arse you're going to kiss. As long as they've got you under their thumb With T.V. lobotomy and media fun, They'll have their way with you, what more can I say? Watch out for the mind police and have a nice day."
CR050,Mother Love,Crass,"Mummy and daddy owned me till I could understand That at the end of my arm was my own fucking hand. In my head I had a brain that they filled up with lies, I didn't fucking need them with their love and family ties. Little children shouldn't speak until they're spoken to, They're just another showpiece to show the neighbours who Can produce the perfect babe with everything in place, But god help you if you come out without an angel face. If you haven't got the looks that prove how nice you are, You'll have failed your duty and that's all you fucking are, You're just a status symbol that they need to have in life, Just the proof they need to be the perfect man and wife. Mummy and daddy owned me till I could understand That at the end of my arm was my own fucking hand. In my head I had a brain that they filled up with lies, I didn't fucking need them with their love and family ties. Like a fucking dustbin they fill you up with trash, And tell you all that life is, is working for some cash, Life's a competition and you've got to be the best, So tread on everybody else, forget about the rest. They tell you to be grateful for what they've done to you, Like tell you the conditions and pump it into you, That you really mustn't fail them cos you owe them a debt, Cos they're the ones that made you and they won't let you forget. Mummy and daddy owned me till I could understand That at the end of my arm was my own fucking hand. In my head I had a brain that they filled up with lies, I didn't fucking need them with their love and family ties. You're not a human in their eyes, you're a novelty. They don't want you thinking, you'll break the fantasy, The fantasy that you're the toy providing endless fun, You're not a human being, you're their daughter or their son. You bring them lots of happiness when you're very small, But when you lose those darling looks no-one cares to call, Cos you're no more the cuddly toy for them to hug and hold, You're not an individual and they're just getting old. Mummy and daddy owned me till I could understand That at the end of my arm was my own fucking hand. In my head I had a brain that they filled up with lies, I didn't fucking need them with their love and family ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and family ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and bloody ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and bloody ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and family ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and bloody ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and bloody lies, I didn't fucking need them with their love and bloody ties, I didn't fucking need them with their love and bloody lies."

Switch on the set, light up the screen, Fantasise and dream about what you might have been, Who needs controlling when they've got the cathode ray? They've got your fucking soul, now they'll fuse your brains away. Mindless fucking morons sit before the set, Being fed the mindless rubbish they deserve to get. Can't switch off big brother, they've lost all will to act, Lost in drab confusion, was it fiction, was it fact? Another plastic bullet stuns another Irish child, But no-one's really bothered, no, the telly keeps them mild. They've lost all sense of feeling to the every hungry glow, Drained of any substance by the vicious telly blow. No longer know what's real or ain't, slowly going blind, They stare into the goggle box while the world goes by, behind. The Angels are on T.V. tonight, grey puke fucking shit. The army occupy Ireland, but the boot will never fit. Was it Coronation Street? Or was it Londonderry? Oh it doesn't fucking matter, Paul Daniels'll keep us merry. Yes, I've heard of Bobby Sands, wasn't it Emmerdale Farm? Yes, that's right, he was kicked by a cow, I hope it didn't do him no harm. And wasn't the Holocaust terrible, good thing it wasn't for real. Of course I've heard of H-Block, it's the baccy with man appeal. Deeper and deeper and deeper, layer upon layer. Illusion, confusion, is there anyone left who can care? Yes, the Abbey National cares for you. Nat West, and Securicor. Well brings out the Branston bren-guns let's spice it up some more. The Sweeney are cruising Brixton, created another Belfast. And J.R.'s advising Thatcher on lighting, make up and cast. A thousand camera lenses point at the people's pain, As millions of mindless morons watch the action replay again, the action replay again. Softly, softly, into your life, you're held in it's brilliant glow. Softly, softly, feeding itself on the you you'll never know. You're life's reduced to nothing, but an empty media game. Big Brother ain't watching you mate, you're fucking watching him."

Do you think I've got nothing better to do than to grovel in the shit and the crap, Asking for the bread and home that's mine and waiting for a pat on the back? You think I've got nothing better to do than to live in the lie that you give? Learn the sweet morals, the lessons, the games and praise god for the fact that I live? You took me and made me a MAN By making me strong, the power of this land. You took a woman and taught her she's less, A slave to the strong no more than a guest. You taught me to love, find a mate and to take A woman to serve but your love is just rape. You leave me my children to hold and distort, To bind with your rules of normality till caught. I give them the food that you sell in the shops, I'm told is has goodness when it's only the slops. You've taken my health with your shitty benevolence, You've take my dignity with your dole queue dependence. You taught me to steal when I wanted to share, To take for myself and not even care. You've stifled my vision with oppressive authority, The dreams and the hopes nearly fade to strangle me. You gave me confusion until I had learnt To obey all the orders and never get burnt. I shout in the streets and you take my voice, This sham of democracy leaves no choice. You've taken my eyes till there's nothing to see Except abuse and destruction, no chance to be free. You've taken my thinking, my means of survival, Thrust in my hand your gun and your bible. You told me to kill for the lord up above, You've given me hate when I KNOW THERE IS LOVE. You told me to kill for the lord up above, You've given me hate when I KNOW THERE IS LOVE."
CR053,Beg Your Pardon,Crass,"Beg the question, bend the truth Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof In the beginning they said there was light, Well there ain't much left of it now. We're lost in the darkness, searching sound and sight Of an answer to the what, where or how. We're talking 'bout freedom while we're locked in a cell, Dreaming of a world without war, Forced to live on the boundaries of hell Like no-one's ever thought of peace before. What's the point of preaching peace if it's something you don't feel? What's the point of talking love if you think that love ain't real? Where's the hope in hopelessness? Where's the truth in lies? Don't try to hold my hand if you can't look me in the eyes. Beg the question, bend the truth Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof In the beginning they said there was light But somebody's burnt out the fuse. And now we're all lost in eternal night Looking for a candle to use. Lots of little candles, isolated hope, Frail little flames in the gale, Lost little people who just can't cope, Just knocking their heads on the nail. What's the point of talking freedom if you just protect yourself? What's the point of preaching sharing as you accumulate your wealth? It's so easy to be giving if the things you give ain't real. It's so easy to lie if your ignore the things you feel. Beg the question, bend the truth Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof In the beginning they said there was light But we never had the eyes to see. But rather than struggling or putting up a fight We ran like lemmings to the sea. No-one really wants to get it all together, It's easier to just grab what you can. Everybody's going it, hell for leather, Building little castles in the sand. Hypocrisy, delusion, lies, pretence, deceit, Think only of yourself and the world's at your feet I don't believe the things you say, you make bullshit of the truth. The game you play's offensive and you life's the living proof. Beg the question, bend the truth Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof Beg the question, bend the truth Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof In the beginning they said there was light But I'm tired of hearing their lies. I'm tired of deceit, gonna put up a fight, I'm going to use my own eyes. Gonna make my decisions, live my own life, They can keep their darkness and gloom. Hypocrisy, trickery, I've had enough, They can keep their destruction and doom. I've only one life and I'll live it my way, They can keep their restrictions and law.

CR054,Birth Control 'n' Rock 'n' Roll,Crass,"Industry on the mercenary bloodpath, Military loves the gory warbath, Economics shape the battle landscape, All join together for the grand rape. Moral intentions make a scapegoat, Excuse the rotting corpse inside the trenchcoat. Praise the rotting minds above the club tie That sits in towers up in the blue sky, Above the clouds, obscure the scarred earth, Discuss manoeuvres, moves for more death, Arms make profit from the crushed head, Build the towers up on the ditch head. Betrayal forms the formal skyline, Tinted windows catch the sunshine, Such ice cold beauty makes the heart sink, Five thousand miles away the dead stink. And here the graveyard to insult them, The city shines with laughing tombstones. The profiteers, the warcry butchers, Stir up the lust for legal slaughter. The living dead who look up to them, Who accept authority that kills them, Work for the corporation making napalm, Workers watch the burning children on T.V. As they eat their meat pie With refusal in their minds Eye to see their own lives in that cold death, Their state of wealth upon that lost breath. In the official offices of deathplan Leaders of men work to betray man. Stocks and shares declare the next war, The torture starts behind the locked door, Propaganda tops the big desk. Compose an overture to fine death. The hideous grey men of our nightmares Dim the colour, foul the clean air, Their eyes forsake all that they dwell on, Drag the lover from the loved ones. Patriots progress is a backstep, A cruel noose around a young neck. They teach our children in the classroom To respect a madman on a rostrum, To praise the dirty works of battle, Bring out the ribbon, balloon and rattle, To dig their own graves in the cold earth... So sad and pointless now to give birth."

Now she's sponging down the cooker, on the surface all is fine His dinner's in the oven cos he's doing overtime She switches on the telly, it makes her feel secure Helps confirm her way of life, who needs to ask for more She sees the happy family unit, wife and hubby on the screen The perfect social unit, just like it's always been She's done the very best she can To love and honour and obey her man And if she should ever doubt the wisdom of her choice She can turn on the television for its moderating voice The ads and weekly series are the proof she needs That a life of boredom outweighs the deeds She sits up till the epilogue and goes to bed alone Content that when he's finished work he'll go straight home Meanwhile he downs another scotch, the lady has a coke And if he's asked about the wife he treats it as a joke ""Hear the one about the you-know-what"" He's got what it takes and he takes what he's got He took his woman and he'll take plenty more She took on a rat to keep the wolf from the door Then maybe in her loneliness she'll want to have a child Who'll be taught the games of adulthood, boxed and filed Another life to whitewash, to us a child is born To follow in its parents' tracks, the path's well worn Fantasy and falsehood, truth and lie The fucked up system they call reality The system needs its servants, each birth is one more Gently talk of freedom as they quietly lock the door Cos the system needs its servants if the system's going to run Needs its fodder for the workhouse, its targets for the gun."

Being tough'n'tough is my kind of fun But, of course I never do no harm. Ain't my fault I like cracking bones, Gives me a funny kind of thrill, And I can't help smiling at the pathetic moans, When I go in for the kill. Tribal wars are raging, there's a battlefield on the street, There's games to play And hell to pay When the rival tribal rebels meet. Why can't people just leave me be? Can't help doing what I do, I'll do anybody who ain't like me So forget your what, why or who. I ain't got no purpose and I don't give a fuck, I never asked for this life.

Tribal wars are raging, no-one's safe out on their own, The gangs are about And they scream and shout, So you'd better not be caught alone. I did it cos there ain't nothing else to do, Nowhere'll let me in... It ain't my fault I want to hurt and screw So I've destroyed every place where I've been. I had trouble at the local so they won't serve me there, I just had to chivvy up this bloke, Left him with a smile cut from ear to ear. But the bleeder never got the joke. I used to have a bird but I put her up the spout So I had to tell her where to get off. Well, you can't blame me if I want to get about, If you're a man you've gotta be tough. I used to go down the cafe for tea But my boot got attacked by the door, So now it ain't open for the likes of me And we're back on the streets like before. Tribal wars are raging, our heroes are standing tall, But the truth of the matter, If you cut out the patter, Is that pride always comes before the fall. They can stand on the corner With their violence and their hate, Stand there and fester Till they've left it too late To realise it's themselves they've put their on the spot Cos they've wasted the one and only life that they've got. Tribal wars are raging, everyone's acting out bad parts, Hey big man, take a look at yourself it's in the mirror that the real war starts."

Lots of little people who'll put you in the ground. Well, take a burning issue and stuff it up your arse. They've fucked you with a furrowed brow, shitting broken glass, Marching down the 'dilly to demonstrate again, While the men who plan the holocaust are pissed out of their brain.

MP's got his duty, priest has got his sin, Everybody finds a hole, to drop somebody in. Seeking out wisdom in the ironies of life, Weighing up subtleties, fiddling with the ties, No-one else decides for you, whether to or not, You make an easy target if you're running on the spot.

Peeping through a frown, your humanity in rags, Playing the loser till the sense of purpose sags, They can deal with heroes, watch the bleeders run, It's only your head keeps the target from the gun.

CR062,Sentiment (White Feathers),Crass,"Feathers burn so easily, The cat is blinded in the garden, Last vision the lark is flame. The cattle shed gives off the smell Of sunday kitchen, the gentle eye, The dispensable perfection. Before the flash takes two weeks' food, Pile the sacks of earth and hide. All of us here know it, we grew it. Fighting amongst ourselves, Leaving bits of flesh on barbed wire, A little blood on the floor. Locks and bars across the door, Well versed in violation, Our children beat each other in the garden. Our failure to accept the earth, We talk of love but push it to the edge. Push it to the edge. This is no natural aggression Composing death, I am afraid for beauty When I see the fist, the perfect hand that turns Against itself, the perfect hand That holds a gun or wields a butcher's Blade, or leads to death, Leads to death the used-up bull Or incarcerates the hopeless fool Or takes the forest with a single flame Leaves the nest an empty shell. Human kind condemns the hunting beast Yet their own choice leaves behind such ragged meat. The military dream of blood, their sweet wine flowing in the veins of men who work towards our bloody end. They fly Enola gaily, give birth to this waiting... waiting, give us the reality of our hatred, give the earth nothing. Melting, goats dead on the green, dying lambs bleating by the wire... three last days on the earth, I lay down to die in the grass."
CR063,Major General Despair,Crass,"We're looking for a better world, but what do we see? Just hatred, poverty, aggression, misery. So much money spent on war When three quarters of the world is so helplessly poor. Major General Despair sits at his desk, Planning a new mode of attack, He's quite unconcerned about chance or risk, The Major General's a hard nut to crack. Oh yes, he designs a cruise missile, Tactically sound, operationally O.K., While the starving crawl onto the deathpile, They can't avoid their fate another day. Attack on the mind, but he calls it defense, But I ask you again who's it for? Do the starving millions who don't stand a chance Hope to benefit by his stupid war? Babies crippled with hunger before they could walk, Mothers with dry breasts cry dry tears, And meanwhile Major General Despair gives a talk On increasing the war budget over the years. How can they do it, these men of steel, How can they plot destruction, pain? Is it the only way that they can feel, By killing again and again? Is it some part of themselves that has died That permits them to plan as they do? Or is it us that is dead, do we simply hide From the responsibility to stop what they do? There's so many of us, yet we let them have their way, At this moment they're plotting and planning. We've got to rise up to take their power away, To save the world that they're ruining. They're destroying the world with their maggot-filled heads, Death, pain and mutilation, They've got the responsibility of millions of dead. Yet they're still bent on destruction. The generals and politicians who advocate war should be made to wade in the truth of it, They should spend sleepless nights shivering with fear and by day time should crawl in the deathpit. They'll find the truth of what they've done there, Festering corpses they and their kind made, Eyeless skulls that endlessly stare Having seen the truth of military trade. The earth was our home, the wind and the air, The blue sky, the grass and the trees, But these masters of war, what do they care? Only sentiments, these. It's our world but through violence they took it away, Took dignity, happiness, pride. They took all the colours and changed them to grey With the bodies of millions that died. They destroy real meaning through their stupid games, Make life a trial of fear. They destroy what values we have with their aims, Make us feel it's wrong if we care. Well, we do care, it's our home, they've been at it too long, If it's a fight they want, it's beginning. Throughout history, we've been expected to sing their tired song But now it's our turn to lead the singing... Fight war, not wars, Make peace, not war. Fight war, not wars, We know you've heard it before. Fight war, not wars, Make peace, not war. Fight war, not wars, Make peace, not war. Fight war, not wars, Make love, not war. Fight war, not wars, Make love, not war. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 We don't want your fucking war. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 We don't want your fucking war. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 We don't want your fucking war."

Alone, the possibilities are enormous Step outside and parasites Deprived of their meat Wait to suck on tiring flesh Unending statistics that fatten leaders Prisoners of their morality Afraid of death We can not save ourselves To breathe... is not enough) When you woke this morning you looked so rocky-eyed Blue and white normally, but strange ringed like that in black It doesn't get much better, your voice can get just ripped up shouting in vain Maybe someone hears what you say, but you're still on your own at night You've got to make such a noise to understand the silence Screaming like a jackass, ringing ears so you can't hear the silence Even when it's there. Like the wind seen from the window Seeing it but not being touched by it Words sometimes don't seem to mean much Of anyone we've used more that most Feelings from the heart that have been distorted and mocked Thrown around in the spectacle: the grand social circus! Up against the rows of grey robots who control our lives The things we have to offer sometimes seem so frail As they plan destruction and gain respectability We offer our creativity and are made outcasts! We didn't expect to find ourselves playing this part We were concerned with ideas, not rock and roll But we can't avoid that arena It's become a part of us even if we don't understand it! In attempts to moderate they ask why we don't write love songs What is it that we sing then? Our love of life is total Everything we do is an expression of that! Everything that we write is a love song!! We look for alternatives But the enormous power of the media makes it so difficult To establish foundations. Their lies and distortions are so extreme That everything becomes poisoned and corrupted We can become media personalities, but it is always on their terms We're tired of living up to other people's expectations when our own are so much higher Intelligence seems so easily dismissed when it doesn't conform to mainstream values Lennon said ""They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool"" He was right! Social intelligence merely requires agreement and compromise! The boundaries are becoming narrower as the State becomes more paranoid Under authoritarian rule, conformity becomes the only security... Fear is a powerful weapon against human development Cowering in our temples of self there's little chance of change The State is aware of that The bomb serves many functions If fear of the omnipotent God is no more The nuclear Father will govern with his shepherd's crook Drawing his flock closer to the valley of the shadow of death Those of us who stand out against the status quo Do so against all odds We cling so closely together Because we have little other than ourselves Critics say that it's just punk rock or that we're just naive anarchists They hope to discredit us with their labels and definitions! Throughout history societies have condemned those who are later celebrated as heroes In so many bourgeois homes Van Gogh's sunflowers radiate from the walls Yet he lived in utter misery, condemned by those very same people Why is it that the kind and gentle are subjected to violence and riducule? How is it that the small and mealy-minded have gained so much power? What perversion has taken place that we are governed by fools? We've had problems from self-appointed Gods from Bishops to MPs They've tried to ban our records saying that we're a threat to decent society Fuck them! I hope we are! What kind of depraved idiot thinks they can silence others by denying them their voice? For fucks sake, who are these lobotomists? As if walls only had one side Whispered intimacies might not get through But cries of anguish know no barriers But how long do we shout for? Denied the airwaves, we trust in the wind to carry what we say But sometimes we've found ourselves shouting into the wind When we should have been confiding in each other It seems so absurd that we are denied the chance of ever being truly free The terrible inequalities of the peoples of this earth Make freedom at best a dream, at worst an insulting privilege What space is there for self-expression and personal development When over half the world's population is starving? There are so many things that might have been done But rooted on this spot in the desire to find solution There's little to see and feel but the sighing and dying of our world But for suffering we might have been a part of it rather than apart from it"

And if there was no police force, tell me what you'd do If thirty thousand rioters came running after you? And who would clean the sewers? Who'd mend my television? Wouldn't people lay about without some supervision? Who'd drive the fire engines? Who'd fix my video? If there were no prisons, well, where would robbers go? And what if I told you to fuck off? What if there's no army to stop a big invasion? Who'd clean the bogs and sweep the floors? We'd have all immigration. Who'd pull the pint at the local pub? Where'd I get my fags? Who'd empty out my dustbins? Would I still get plastic bags? If there were no hospitals, and no doctors too, If I'd broken both my legs, where would I run to? If there's no medication, if there were no nurses, Wouldn't people die a lot? And who would drive the hearses? And what if I told you to fuck off? If there were no butchers shops, what would people eat? You'd have everybody starving if they didn't get their meat. If there was no water, what would people drink? Who'd flush away the you-know-what? But of course MINE never stink. What about the children? Who'd teach them in the schools? Who'd make the beggars keep in line? Learn them all the rules? Who'd tell us whitewash windows? When to take down doors? Who'd tell us make a flask of tea and survive the holocaust?"
CR067,A Rock 'n' Roll Swindler,Crass,"The rock and roll swindler says it's O.K. to plunder, So the pirates set sail to rape any ethnic culture they can plug a mike to. The imperialists rub their hands in glee As the slave-boy hunts out butt-ends in the garbage cans. Is it any wonder there was such sickening celebration over the Task Force When so called radicals work hand in hand with the ruling elite? Yesterday those wily creeps rejected the status quo, Today they smarm and charm passageways to its very heart. Where's the free individual in all that? Where's the hope and aspiration? Identities have become corporations, Social egos and media moulds, Scholars of ad-man's dreams. Prescribed futures; Must we all down aspirins and shine beneath borrowed tans? Are we really so dumb, so cowered into submission That not only are we prepared to eat shit We're also prepared to say thanks for the privilege? Why should we accept servility as a bargain for dignity? Why should we passively accept death as a bargain for living? Why accept this robbery of life? Why accept this pillage? For Christ's sake take up your bed and walk. Let the blind see end the deaf hear. The rights of the individual are dependent upon You realising your right as an individual. People are so easily deluded into thinking they've instrumented choice Where in reality they're nothing but passive observers. Passive observers do nothing but passively observe, Passively soak up creativity and say ""Wow, that's me!"", Passively soak up destruction and say ""Oh no, not us, not me"". There are those who strive for value and meaning; Who search for reason and purpose; Their efforts are negated by the passive observers. They spend days before the T.V. set so burned out, Is it any wonder they've lost all sense of vision and possibility? What chance does anyone have when all the spaces are filled? Sipping breakfast teas to the sound of Space Invaders. Television is today's Nuremberg. Bowing to its authority, they become it. I've seen four year old children conforming to media roles. Main-lining the gross theatre that will become their lives. The television has so dampened people's anger. The population is mesmerised by the flickering screen And the streets, where the politics of reality were once created, Are deserted at night and the rulers sleep secure. They are under no threat as long as the people are sedated. Those who suffer head-aches from excessive intake of electrons are prescribed valium, Or pay for a fix at the pub where men have to piss up the wall And the stench of urine lasts well into the next pint. Entertainment is designed to gloss over real problems And very often those who profess dissent only add to the deception. Words are banded about, but always at the whim of the puppeteer. Actionless sloganeering is just another Punch and Judy show. Any information that we receive concerning the real world is carefully controlled, Why else would fiction have such licence? We are allowed to see endless theatrical deaths, But when the real deaths started on the Falklands Government censors prevented us from seeing them. We were given the excuse of 'National Security' By the lying shits who were interested only in saving their political skins. It didn't matter a fuck to them how many died As long as their popularity ratings didn't suffer, For that reason alone we were shielded from the truth. While the real violence is kept from us We are exposed to constant pantomimes of death and destruction. Those in power are rightly aware that if we had access to the real facts We would cease to be simply passive observers. Media coverage of Viet Nam created massive dissent in the U.S.A. Thatcher's government was aware of that when, embarking on the Falkland charade, They refused press cards to anyone who they knew would not support their line. Those who did travel to the Falklands found their reports dramatically cut down. Meanwhile, at home, we were fed fabrications of Britain's 'glorious war'. The truth that is now filtering out paints a very different picture. It's often been said that truth is the first casualty of war, It is, but the same could be said of life. From birth we are threatened and beaten into submission By family, church, school and state. From then on we're easy game for the powermongers. Like pathetic circus dogs we hunt out praise Or, when our true nature finds its way to the surface We hide in the darkness, our tails between our legs. At all costs we are prevented from realising our own potential. We are conditioned into being passive observers. If the ring-master offers war, We have been conditioned to passively accept it. War can only exist through passive acceptance. It is nothing but a demonstration of the weakness of human will. If the clown offered peace We will have been conditioned to accept that too, But peace can not and will not be maintained through passive acceptance. Peace will require constant demonstrations of personal strength, Constant effort, constant hard work, Reappraisal, consideration and devotion. Which of those qualities were you taught in schoolroom? Whereas war simply requires the masses as cannon-fodder, Peace requires individuals to realise their own potential, The odds are hopelessly against because the State deliberately destroys human will. Passive observers offer nothing but decay. The flowerbeds need weeding, the roses need cutting back before winter. Freed from sedation, released from bondage, People would demonstrate their own strength, But the powerful elite are aware of this And already have tabs on those who they regard as subversives. It is easy for them to single out and intimidated us And easier still for us simply not to bother."
CR068,Burying The Hatchet,Crass,"It is impossible to gauge the effect that demands for peace may be having, The authorities are skilled at concealing dissatisfaction. For so long people have been saying ""No more war"", But for all those demands little has changed. Seeing that the Peace Movement was growing in strength, Thatcher appointed Heseltine as Minister of Defence. One specific part of his job is to discredit CND, Such is the nature of Conservative democraty. As pacifist we are too easily forced back into tokenism, Making hollow gestures against the wheels of the juggernaut. The line is delicate. The spaces have always been created by the gentle and caring, To be later filled by bullies and egotists. We can try to fill those spaces with the strength of our love. Gandhi called it Ahimsa. The Greenham Wowan call it the 'Politics of Whimsy', But it doesn't end there, neither is it enough. Gandhi played a major role in liberating India from Britain rule, But conditions in India are still appaling for the ordinary people. Limiting Greenham Peace Camp to women only is a sensible political ploy, But if it is a demonstration of sexual exclusivity it is a sham. Aren't we seeking to destroy all forms of exclusivity? Does our own oppression give us the right to oppress others? Unless we are prepared to oppose all oppression, We stand guilty of direct contribution to it. The neo-fascist plunder our land And we must resist them on every level. As outsiders we have few right with which to oppose them, But on our own, together, we seek them. They have their law and those who impose it. We only have ourselves and each other. They have their order and those who impose it. We only have ourselves and each other. It is easy to dismiss those who seek peace as dreamers, But isn't our whole culture built on past dreams? It is essential that our dreams become a reality Or there will cease to be one. Harrods boast that it can supply any whim that its wealthy clients might express, Well let them supply me an Exocet missile and a starving Third World child And I'll tell them the politics of choice. Equality doesn't enter into the ghettos of wealth. Beneath the protective sheath of Thatcher's economy The right, rich and privileged get even richer And they, in turn, support her barbaric policies both at home and overseas. The Falklands war cost Britain over sixteen thousand million pounds - in whose pocket? Throughout the world millions of people are employed making armaments, Don't they realise that it's ordinary people like themselves who'll suffer the effects of their filthy labour? The wealthy obscene with their obscene wealth Applaud the carnage from their grandstand. It's as if they were at Ascot laying their bets; Five to one on the Four Horsemen. They believe that money can buy them out of the responsibility That they have for the world that they bleed dry. They are the true pornographers The real stylists in human perversion. Rich educated tarts sit dumbly by Watching their fortunes rise and fall In the neatly pressed pin-striped trousers of the City. Debutante whores in rich men's castles. The ruling elite with their puppet figurehead Queen Elizabeth the Second, Regina Virgina, Strut about on the million of bodies That they have sacrificed to gain their position. Who are these leaders but those who have made violence pay? Who are they but the inheritors of their ancestors greed and theft? Their blood stained flags are rags to our future, Tattered remnant of our individual rights. These rulers are common murderers and thieves, But still we bow before them. For how long will the masses be so pathetically manipulated by God, Queen and Country? For fucks sake where are we in all this? We're given life yet we court death. For Christ's sake how long? How long, oh Lord, how long? Still we lay prostrate before a stylised figure on a crucifix. As if the stone fool might be resurrected. We are expected to bargain our lives for his And join him in the ugliness of perpetual Christian guilt. He hangs there as a remainder of our own subjugation. Let it be known that he alone is Christ, Those who dare emulate him shall suffer thus. Each settlement is spiked with that stupid image, Each conscience nailed to that diet of corruption. Military acts are bathed in those gory tales. Tired Marines, edgy to fuck and sleep, are blessed in his name. Pious virgins in desire kneel in worship before the myth. In anticipation of their own death, they await his coming. Sweet Jesus have mercy on me. Sweet Jesus, they share his agony. Sweet Jesus, they share his misery. Fuck his loaded deity."
CR069,Taking Sides,Crass,"Over half the world's population is starving, Crucified by the greed of landowners, Helpless against the imbalance of priorities Practiced by the major powers who, if they wanted to, could help. Every minute of the day millions upon million of pounds Are spent on the machinery of war. If only a half of that was spent on the machinery of peace, There would be no more starvation on this planet. Yet governments pay no heed to the cries of suffering, They perhaps make token gestures to appease their consciences, But no real improvements are made Because to ensure control the superpowers need to maintain the imbalance. Natives are slaughtered in their homelands By governments seeking out new possessions. Most of the wealth of the so called developed nations Has been gained at the expense of the Third World From whom natural resources, both mineral and human, Have been unscrupulously exploited. Peoples' pride and dignity is burnt in Napalm And hand-held flame-throwers. The poor and underprivileged are raped and tormented By leaders who use their power not to assist, but to oppress. At the wave of a gloved hand These people can, and do, Send young men to their death, But not before others too have fallen from their bayonets and guns. Such armies are invariably called 'peace keeping forces'. The hypocrisy is as appalling as it is obvious. The wealthy, educated, privileged and secure Make the lives of those less fortunate a complete misery. Million upon millions of people are dying from malnutrition Because, to stabilise their economies, governments destroy food rather than giving it to the needy. ""Let them eat cake"" said Marie Antoinette As she wiped the calf's blood from her lips. ""Proud to be British"" said Margaret Thatcher As she wiped the Falkland's blood from her hands. The ruling elite have no concept of what it is to suffer want, Yet it is they who are directly responsible. In a world where there are people who can't afford a crust of bread, These arrogant scabs drive around in Bentleys and Rolls Royces. Perhaps it amuses them to rub shit into the faces of the poor, But there'll come a time when such overt displays of wealth Will not be tolerated by the people in the street. In a sane society wealth and possession would not be an asset. A few years ago a politician was on the radio Saying that no one in the UK suffered from want. Next day I saw an old man pleading for a handful of coal; His wife was dying of cold and he was penniless. Maybe in the morning, as the politician sipped breakfast tea, She lay cold and dead before the empty grate. Every year thousand of people die of hypothermia, Too hungry, too cold, too poor to stay alive. At times of national crisis it's always the poor who suffer. ""Back Britain"" we're told As the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. At times of international crisis it's the same story. ""Back Britain"" we're told As the rich get richer and the poor get killed. In the event of a nuclear crisis, The rich will retreat to private bunkers with their wealth and possessions. The injustice of inequality is sanctioned by the church. With its tradition of finance from the gentry The church has always been obliged To ensure that its flock remains servile. ""Repent ye sinners or be devoured in the flames of hell."" Those very same flames that devoured their enemies in countless religious wars. So often the church has marched hand in hand with the military Casting its blessings upon the writhing bodies of the battlefield. Each stab of bayonet is God's word. Each crash of steel is God's word. Each torn limb and splash of blood is God's word. For he so loved the world he gave our only begotten sons. Each sodden grave and sodding death is God's word. For he so loved the world he gave our only begotten sons. For he so loved the world he gave our only begotten sons. In Christian societies executions are attended by representatives of the church. Goggle-eyed before the gallows, the electric chair and the gas-chamber They administer their Christ's blessing. In America poison is injected into the blood-stream. Another Christ dies, jacked up by the state. Another glorious advance for civilisation. One small step for man. One giant step for mankind. For he so loved the world. He gave us his only begotten son And likewise we are expected so to do. For he so loved the world. Violent, vicious hypocrisy. How is anyone supposed to deal with these contradictions, Confusions and lies? They defy reason. Oh yes, you can inwardly laugh at the absurdity, Satirise the obscenity, but the hysteria soon wears thin And the tears wear a colder complexion. Humour can offer diversion, But it dilutes real anger And nothing gets confronted. We are ruled by dangerous mad-people, What's funny about that for fucks sake? The world is daily threatened with annihilation, Is that really something to be trivialased? The world is under constant threat. Against this background of fear We struggle to create our own authority. While being bludgeoned into conformity We struggle to find our inner selves. Of course I feel uncomfortable when I'm laughed at in the streets, But I don't want to be one of them. I want to be an outsider, At the same time I'd like to come in out of the cold. Urgency overrules personal fears. Against the scenario of total destruction We demand a sanity that might save the world. That alone excludes us from the mainstream of thought. History offers no solutions, Quotes from Mao or Stalin, Hitler or Marx Simply confirms the oppression. I'm tired of political experts, Tired of 'if onlys'. They have always been the same people, Grey visionless robots Who would have us all share their death. History is simply a justification for oppression, Written by those who practice it. It is being constantly changed and rewritten To conform to the requirements of the ruling elite. A tempest of convenience that blasts across the blistered bodies of the dead. We receive at best only filtered truths. Most of what we see and hear is lies. The Falklands War was rewritten as it happened. It was not a glorious victory for the British spirit, Nor an heroic defeat of a fascist dictator. It was a callous and savage piece of electioneering Designed to cover up horrific domestic problems. At a time when a peaceful settlement was a possibility, Thatcher personally ordered the sinking of the General Belgrado Killing over three hundred men And horribly mutilating many more. She did this because her political neck required bloodshed To prove her wisdom in releasing the Task Force. The history books will not document her as a cold-blooded murderer. I'm tired of the dull rationalisation of the politicians. Weighed down with their sums and inadequacies I feel only anger and bellied hatred for them. How can anyone become so distorted? How can anyone be so far from real human values? I feel only disgust for their twisted minds. How can peace be achieved through threats of violence? What kind of hope is there in that strait-jacket? The authority of those who oppress us Is supported, maintained and defended By those who are themselves the most oppressed; Those who, because they have no alternative, are in service to the rulers. How can I feel anger towards the squaddy? Weighed down with his guns and inadequacies I can feel only pity and bellied compassion. How can anyone be so distorted? How can anyone be so far from real human values? I can only feel pity for his twisted mind. How can freedom be achieved if the poor fight to uphold The privileges of those who directly oppress them? We look through one eye hoping the other won't see, That way we only need deal with a half of it. Like bloody ostriches, oblivious, Not because we are, but because we choose to be. Most people see through the lies But are too afraid to admit it. It's so much easier to be the passive observer. How much longer can people afford to just sit by like this? All the indications are there. Massive unemployment, Recession, depression. But who's looking? Who cares? Tamely the population is being led down the road to total bondage. Government is daily strengthening its powers. Those who stand against it are ridiculed, Discredited or abused and punished. Those in power are totally cynical. Rather than analysing the seriousness of the problem They simply strengthen the army and police to combat it They are ready for the inevitable response. It happened in Brixton, Toxteth and Moss Side. It happens daily in Northern Ireland. Under Thatcher's regime there has been massive increases in police brutality. In London police shot down a man Only to find it was the wrong person. We regret to inform you. Regret to inform you. Regret to inform you. We regret to inform you That today another Christ was shot in the back of the head. We regret to inform you. Regret to inform you, That another Christ, not yet ten years old, was shot today, By agents of Her Majesty's Government, with a plastic bullet. They say that plastic bullets were designed not to kill, They do. I say that human beings were not designed to kill, not us, not me; We do. We regret to inform you. 1984 is a book about the positive danger of totalitarianism, Under Thatcher's unfeeling guidance the scenario is one year early. With the cold mechanism of the pin ball arcade We're flicked around as numbers by the hidden computers. Software in the hardware. Documented and filed. We have no access to the information that they have stored on us. Ticker-tape alter egos, print-out portraits. We are becoming another. As individuals within that mechanical system we are arbitrary, Wanted only for what can be taken from us. Our future is of no concern to the mega-corporations Who determine the nature of our economic well-being. Thatcher's policies require massive unemployment Which makes her order to 'support our boys' nothing but a fucking insult. When they were eight thousand miles away dying for her arrogance She fabricated what was a complete mockery of compassion. When they're at home, jobless on the streets, She doesn't give a fuck for them. Self determination and self enterprise are her big lines, But just how much of that does she offer to others In her contemptible use of people? She was prepared to risk world peace Saying that it was for the self determination of the Falklanders, Those very same people who over a year ago She was prepared to abandon without a thought. And now, for all her empty talk, They are forced to live in a fortress waiting for further hostilities. Thatcher has recently sanctioned a loan of one hundred million pounds to Argentina Claiming that it was to stabilise world economy. The purchase of further Exocets and the development of nuclear potential Should do much for world economy, but very little for world security. Just what the fuck was all that bloodshed for? Thatcher has signed away British self-determination in one single stroke. She has agreed to install deadly cruise missiles on British soil Over which the Americans have total control. The American military presence is designed solely To limit nuclear war with Russia to the 'European Theatre'. Meanwhile we are sold the wicked lie of protection and deterrence. American war planners have repeatedly stated that they intend To fight the Third World War on European soil; Cruise missiles greatly increase the danger of that happening. Designed to avoid radar detection by skimming the earth's surface, Cruise missiles are seen as the ideal 'first strike weapon', They also guarantee a massive response that would make Britain into a nuclear desert. Military naivety is astounding. The experts seriously believe That they will be able to limit war to the 'theatre'. In this particular show the world will be the stage, There'll be no encore. Thatcher and her cronies talk of 'limited tactical response' And 'executive action' causing 'collateral damage'. These terms are borrowed from their American counterparts And are designed to mask the ugly reality that they describe. In everyday language 'collateral damage' simply means civilian deaths. In the event of nuclear attack on Britain that would amount to thirty-eight million people. Is it any wonder that these crazy psychotics Invent jargon to assist them in their studied madness? Every year hundreds of innocent people still die horrific deaths As a result of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is probably that an all out nuclear war Would destroy all life on planet Earth. We are not talking fantasy, Nor preaching doom. We are talking of an existing reality; The one that we allow to exist around us. Defence Secretary Heseltine disputes the kind of information that we offer Claiming that it has 'no basis in fact'. There are no words to describe the utter contempt That we feel for people of his kind. They sit in their seats of power Distorting and perverting all human decency. How can they dare be so blatant? How can they dare be so hypocritical? Who is this Heseltine with his corrupt lies? Who is this Thatcher with her arrogant deceit? These hideous mutants cast their shadows Across all that is worthwhile and good. Cruise missile will be installed because Thatcher has created some kind of deal with Reagan. We will probably never know the details of that arrangement. It will almost certainly involve some kind of economic juggling act, The massive corporations turning political thumbscrews On U.S. investment in Britain. Russian tanks in Afghanistan are nothing Compared with the bargaining power of American capital in the UK. Whatever the nature of that deal is, It has made Britain into America's front line, The fifty-third State, with no rights of citizenship. To many people that might not matter, Fed from birth on American propaganda and Hollywood trash, The resistance levels are low. As long as we passively accept American domination We can except no real advance. We are being sold down the line. To many people the missiles and warheads might not matter. To many people nuclear reality is too huge to contemplate, Yet for all people the reality looms constantly in nightmares. In the nuclear state we are expected to accept those nightmares. Is this really all that we can hope for as life? Is this really all that we can hope for as death? Maybe our lives don't matter that much, But why impose our madness on future generations? Or is it perhaps that you no longer believe that there will be future generations? In your passive acceptance of it You have already allowed the holocaust to happen. The future is ended. We are not talking fantasy, Nor preaching doom. We are talking of an existing reality, The one that we allow to exist around us. The nuclear hardware produces in the last three decades Will pollute the Earth for thousands of years. A nuclear war will destroy it. Is that why the cherry trees blossom? You are destroying and corrupting. In condemning them to the nuclear nightmare Are you willing to accept the burning of tomorrow's unborn? They know nothing of this sorrow. Suffer little children to come unto me. Suffer little children to come unto me. Suffer little children to come unto me. Suffer little children to come unto me. In your refusal to act against these hideous dangers You are guilty of being the gutless passive observer. Are you so inhuman that you will let this happen? Just a helpless bystander waving your flag in mute acceptance? Take up your eyes and see. Take up your ears and hear. Take up your mind and think. Take up your life and act. It is up to us all as responsible citizens of Earth To work towards the downfall of the powerful elite. Their rule has created dreadful suffering. Their insanity precludes all reason and compassion, They lie, trick and manipulate. They are the maggots in the flesh of decency, The vultures that pick at the bones of hope, The carriers of famine, war, pestilence, and death. They must be stopped. Why should people die for their insanity? Why should people starve for their insanity? Why should people suffer the spitefulness of their greed? We must not be intimidated by the authority that they appear to have. We must be prepared to oppose them on every level, To fight back in the knowledge that if we don't We will have failed in our responsibility to life itself. It has happened before That the powerless have risen against the oppressor Only to be beaten back. But there have been cases where they have succeeded. Ours is a just cause, It is up to each one of us, alone, to do our best. We must learn to overcome our fears. We must realise that the strength that they have Is the strength that we give them. It is you, the passive observer who has given them this power. You are being used and abused And will be discarded as soon as they've bled what they want from you. You must learn to live with your own conscience, your own morality, your own decision, your own self. You alone can do it. There is no authority but yourself. One squaddy, horrifically burnt in the Falklands War, Was approached by Prince Charles during a presentation. ""Get well soon"" said the Prince, to which the squaddy replied, ""Yes Sir, I will""."

We never asked for war, nor in the joyful colours of our childhood were we conscious of its darkness.) HOW DOES IT FEEL? How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand dead? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand dead? Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death. Your arrogance has gutted these bodies of life, Your deceit fooled them that it was worth the sacrifice. Your lies persuaded people to accept the wasted blood, Your filthy pride cleansed you of the doubt you should have had. You smile in the face of the death cause you are so proud and vain, Your inhumanity stops you from realising the pain That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered. You never wanted peace or solution, From the start you lusted after war and destruction. Your blood-soaked reason ruled out other choices, Your mockery gagged more moderate voices. So keen to play your bloody part, so impatient that your war be fought. Iron Lady with your stone heart so eager that the lesson be taught That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand dead? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand dead?

What right have you to defile those birth? What right have you to devour that flesh? What right to spit on hope with the gory madness That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand dead? Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth. How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand dead? Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death. You accuse us of disrespect for the dead, But it was you who slaughtered out of national pride. Just how much did you care? What respect did you have As you sent those bodies to their communal grave? You buried them rough-handed, they'd given you their all, That once living flesh defiled in the hell That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered. You use those deaths to achieve your ends still, Using the corpses as a moral blackmail. You say ""Think of what those young men gave"" As you try to bind us in your living death, Yet we do think of them, ice cold and silence In the snow covered moorlands, stopped by the violence That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered - It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

CR080,Immortal Death,Crass,"Our boys have returned as men, our men. Our men have returned, amen. The spoils of war. The hero, the lads, men pulled together for war. Set out to fight for the Great British flag that was waved by their thousands ashore. Waving farewell, the girls bare it all and pull up their jumpers and skirts. Carried away the crowd calls for more and the men felt it worth fighting for. It's all gone before, sexy Sue, saucy Jane, The pin-up that's carried to battle. The mascot that marks in every plane, every gun, markers of death, Symbols of men, In whose name we are slaughtered like cattle. In every good war there's a nude on the wall, to keep the men happy and straight. A saucy ole joke lads, it's all harmless fun, when we hit land, who shall we rape? Ah, the spoils of war, the knickers, the bras, momentos to give you support. While the bombs drop around, you fumble in dreams, with blank eyes see the corpses you've fought. Our boys have gone away, our boys, Our boys have gone away. Our men have returned all tattered and burned, Our men have returned, amen. The guns point their muzzles away to the land and below deck the men throw darts The nipples are bullseyes, the head count for less and there's no points for hitting the heart. Shapely Jane, 25, said ""Those lovely real he-men no red-blooded girl can deny Are there for the taking, but it's all so frustrating if your married and already tied"". But bare it all girls and have all the dreams of dashing young soldiers so brave, Send him a garter, a cross, love ever after, for soon he will be in his grave. Ah, those rotting young men who all did their duty are sinking away in the sea And they've missed, just for them, the 'Invincible panties', displayed in The Sun, page three, The bodies of war, the pin-up, the corpses, Flesh that is perfect and torn, The breast that is curved, that is pink and seductive, The breast that is ripped and laid bare, The beckoning arms, the legs that are parted, The welcoming look and the wink, The arms that are shredded, the legs that are no more, The face that is rotten and stinks. (The sickness of war, the men gone before, good luck and God speed you away The madonna is there, stripped naked and bare on the door, she will show you the way.) Our boys have gone away, our boys Our boys have gone away. Our men have returned all tattered and burned Our men have returned, amen. User, abuser, the conquering man makes use of spoils of war, Confirming the glory, the woman is raped and the soldiers rename her as 'whore', Their bodies are torn and disfigured in their heads life is never the same, From the wall saucy Sal is still smiling as the nightmare is caught in his pain, Her body still perfect and tempting is blistered with blood of his tears, His body confused and still frightened turns from the truth that he fears, His friends that were killed for the reason of war that is fought over lies, The pin-up remains ever after immortal as all around dies. Our boys have gone away, Our boys, our boys have gone away. Our men have returned all tattered and burned, Our men have returned, amen, amen, AMEN."
